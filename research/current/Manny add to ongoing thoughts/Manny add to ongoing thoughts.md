# Manny add to ongoing thoughts   
  
  
Hyperion’s encoding of multiple types of data makes me think about this: At some point the information in manny needs to evolve beyond text. If this happens as atomic ‘files’ or built by the collection of clusters in the manifold is still to be explored . For example , a photograph could be the union of multiple points that represent pixels with a colour value , those same pixels can be reused elsewhere, or a photo of a man and a dog would be stored as the collections that represent dog, man, etc. the original can still exist somewhere for reference
