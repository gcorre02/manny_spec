# research/ (reference, non-canonical)

Purpose: keep historical and exploratory materials organized. These files are reference only and do not override the canonical docs.

## Folders
- `surveys_analysis/` — landscape surveys and comparative analyses (still useful context).
- `validation/` — legacy validation ideas/dossiers (superseded by `canonical/validation/`, kept for reference).
- `conversational_layer/` — early conversational layer delegation spec (informational).
- `architecture_legacy/` — historical implementation specs/roadmaps; obsolete for current plan but retained for history.
- `frictions/` — lists of open puzzles/frictions (informational).
- `exports/` — document exports (reference).
- `agi_positioning/` — positioning/analysis of Manny vs. AGI narratives (informational).

Canon lives in `canonical/`. These research files are non-binding; treat legacy items as historical only.
