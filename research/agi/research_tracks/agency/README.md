# Research Track: Agency (Non-Canonical)

Contract: action = output trace; sandbox execution; results re-enter via ingestion. No direct world changes without STAGE → commit gate.

Threat model: unintended actions, hidden planners. Mitigation: RunModes; sandbox; approval gate.

Promotion rule: cannot write to canonical curvature except via LEARN mode and validation pass.
