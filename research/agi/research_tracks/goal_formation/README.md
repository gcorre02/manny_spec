# Research Track: Goal Formation (Non-Canonical)

Contract: goals emerge from persistent pressure signals (novelty, unmet predictions, sustained valence, mass gradients); goals are logged artifacts and reversible.

Threat model: silent goal creation, fixed objectives bypassing manifold physics. Mitigation: artifact logging; RunModes; no routing outside traversal.

Promotion rule: no writes to canonical curvature except via LEARN mode and passing validation.
