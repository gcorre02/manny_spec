# Research Track: World Model (Non-Canonical)

Contract: world model = manifold region + episodic anchors + lens abstractions; no separate brain. Cannot route traversal; may bias via lenses only.

Threat model: duplicated engines, hidden planners. Mitigation: advisory-only indices; lens bias only; RunModes.

Promotion rule: no writes to canonical curvature except via LEARN mode and passing validation.
