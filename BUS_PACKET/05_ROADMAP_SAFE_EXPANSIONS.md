# Roadmap: Safe Expansions (Pointers)

- **Agency track:** action as output trace; sandboxed execution; STAGE → commit gate.
- **Goal formation:** goals from persistent pressure signals (novelty, unmet predictions, sustained valence, mass gradients); logged and reversible.
- **World modeling:** lens + episodic anchors; no second brain; cannot route traversal, only bias via lenses.
- **Self-modification:** staged config proposals; replay against validation suite; explicit approval + rollback.
- **Hardware/analog track:** derived indices are advisory; must preserve determinism and manifold physics.

All tracks must satisfy promotion rules, RunModes, and learning law; no track may write directly to canonical curvature except through `LEARN` mode.
