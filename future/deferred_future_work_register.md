# Manny Manifolds — Deferred & Future Work Register

Status: NON-CANONICAL  
Purpose: track compatible future explorations without committing them to physics or contract.  
Rule: items here may be explored experimentally, but must not violate Canonical v1.1 (see `governance/canonical_freeze_v1.1.md`).

## A. Cognitive Extensions (Conceptual)
1) Virtual Stage / Imagination Sandbox  
- Temporary sub-manifold for rehearsal before committing curvature; discardable geometry; must respect Observation ≠ Learning invariant.
2) Explicit Drive Hierarchy  
- Beyond homeostasis (curiosity, competence, contribution); biases traversal, not action planning; requires formal safety analysis before promotion.
3) Explicit Surprise / Novelty Channel  
- Separate from κ (e.g., transient novelty scalar); must not destabilize curvature physics.

## B. Learning & Physics Experiments
4) Gravity Feedback into Learning  
- Using Φ as a secondary bias signal; currently gravity is interpretation-only; promotion would require a new canonical version.
5) Alternative Curvature Update Laws  
- e.g., signed κ, multi-channel κ; only after current physics is fully exhausted.

## C. Data & Interaction
6) Conversational Layer (Active)  
- Reflective Narrator (system → human); Story / Elicitor (human → system); currently offline and learning-neutral; any learning feedback must be separately gated.
7) Multimodal Inputs  
- Images, audio, sensor traces; must reduce to geometric relations before learning.

## D. System Architecture & Scale
8) Distributed Manifolds  
- Curvature exchange without data exchange; federated geometry; requires new validation protocols.
9) Neuromorphic / Analog Substrates  
- Hardware acceleration for local plasticity; must preserve determinism guarantees.
10) ANN-Accelerated Suggestion Loops  
- Faster candidate discovery; advisory only; never authoritative.

## E. Tooling & UX
11) Rich Interactive Visualizations  
- 3D manifold views; temporal scrubbing of curvature; must remain read-only unless explicitly experimental.
12) Collaborative Multi-User Sessions  
- Shared observation; no shared learning unless merged explicitly.

## Governance rule for deferred items
Any item in this register may be prototyped, simulated, or explored experimentally only if it does not alter canonical physics, or it is clearly marked as an experiment against a specific canonical invariant. Promotion from this register to the canon requires empirical evidence, a formal spec update, and a new canonical version.
