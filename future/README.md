# Future Work (Non-Canonical)

**Status:** Speculative / Non-binding

This directory contains future work, research directions, and deferred items that are explicitly **out of scope** for Manny v1.1 canonical system.

## Boundary with Candidate

- **`canonical/candidate/`** → Constrained, physics-adjacent, spec-like documents that may be compatible with v1.x physics
- **`future/`** → Speculative, product-oriented, AGI positioning, strategy documents that may violate current constraints

## Important

Future documents may violate current constraints and are not expected to be compatible with v1.x physics. They are preserved for future exploration but must not leak into canonical specifications without explicit promotion via versioned process.

## Structure

- `candidate/` — Candidate future work items
- `reference/` — Reference materials for future exploration
- `future_research_map(cannonical).md` — Research roadmap
- `manny_domain_strategy_product_governance_framework.md` — Product and governance framework
