# How Manny Manifolds Can Model Human Behaviour and Enable AGI Research (Non-Canonical)

Status: NON-CANONICAL — exploratory positioning. This document does not alter Canonical v1.1 (see `governance/canonical_freeze_v1.1.md`); it interprets how the existing physics could be used to study human cognition and potential AGI trajectories.

## 1) A concrete “cognitive physics” you can instrument
MM defines cognition as motion through a learned space: threads traverse a concept graph; curvature (κ) stores learned association strength; valence modulates plasticity; consolidation stabilizes over time. That yields a measurable, falsifiable model of how thinking changes with experience.
- Habits / automaticity → repeated trajectories become lower-energy, higher-curvature “highways.”
- Salience / emotion / novelty → multi-channel valence captures why some experiences reshape beliefs more than others.
- Stability vs change → clamps/decay + “sleep” provide a testable stability–plasticity dial.

## 2) Motifs as operational schemas/skills
Motifs are cached subpaths (procedural chunks), mapping to chunking, scripts, and transfer.
- Represent learned routines (coping strategies, social scripts, heuristics).
- Measure generalization: does an agent reuse motifs across contexts or get stuck in local habits?

## 3) Drives as a tractable model of motivation
The six-drive scaffold (stability → contribution) becomes fields/potentials that bias trajectories.
- Anxiety-like patterns: stability-drive dominance + risk-avoidant trajectory selection.
- Curiosity/exploration: competence/creativity weighting and temperature/novelty handling.

## 4) Bicameral dynamics as dual-process cognition
Experiencer/Executive mirrors fast associative vs slow regulatory cognition, with the executive modulating parameters (temperature, learning gain, lens friction) rather than routing paths. It can reproduce impulses vs reflection, rumination vs reappraisal, exploration vs exploitation as control problems.

## 5) How MM can simulate human behaviour (not just represent knowledge)
- “User as manifold” + empathy as simulation: use a transient virtual stage to sandbox “what would another agent do/feel/believe?” by spawning threads in a user-model manifold and comparing predicted to actual trajectories.
- Conversational capture as behaviour data: ingest stories/metaphors as structured artifacts (e.g., StoryPack) and reprocess into geometry later, keeping learning physics stable.
- Conversational vectors for semantic density: make graph content more human-like and context-rich for behavioural modelling via language.

## 6) Why this could be a base for AGI (and what’s missing)
Plausible AGI ingredients already implied:
- Lifelong learning via local updates + consolidation.
- Transparent reasoning (paths are computation; `/why` is intrinsic).
- Compositional skill growth via motifs (chunking/options analogue).
- Meta-control via bicameral regulation and virtual stage (counterfactuals/proto-planning).

Gaps to reach AGI-like breadth (per roadmap):
- Grounding/embodiment beyond text (sensorimotor loops, world models, constraints).
- Robust coherence under open-world noise (bias, spurious associations, corrigibility).
- Scaling + governance: stability, auditability, and safety as the system grows.
