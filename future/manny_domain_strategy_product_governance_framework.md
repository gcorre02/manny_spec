# Manny Domain Strategy — Product & Governance Framework

**Status:** Product strategy (non-canonical, enabling)

**Purpose**
This document describes how Manny can be productized as a *domain-based cognitive infrastructure* that is applicable across industries (law, finance, policy, research, intelligence) without compromising the core research agenda or governance principles.

The strategy is intentionally conservative: Manny is positioned as a system for *owning and inspecting understanding*, not for delivering answers or autonomous action.

---

## 1. Core Product Thesis

> Manny is a domain-native cognitive substrate that allows organizations to build, evolve, and audit their understanding of complex topics over time.

Key reframing:
- Manny does **not** sell answers.
- Manny sells **continuity, traceability, and inspectability of understanding**.
- Each deployment is a *living domain*, not a model instance.

---

## 2. What a “Domain” Means in Manny

A Manny Domain is:
- an isolated manifold
- with its own sources, experiences, and evolution
- governed by explicit curation rules
- fully owned by the client

A domain is **not**:
- a prompt
- a fine-tuned model
- a static knowledge base

Domains evolve only through experience and traversal, and can be replayed, audited, or rolled back.

---

## 3. Domain Roles & Responsibilities

Manny domains explicitly separate responsibility to prevent hidden bias or silent drift.

### 3.1 Domain Curators (Human)

**Who they are:**
- lawyers, analysts, researchers, policy experts

**Responsibilities:**
- define admissible sources
- approve ingestion scope
- introduce new materials
- manage domain boundaries

Curators control *exposure*, not conclusions.

---

### 3.2 Manny (System)

**Responsibilities:**
- ingest experiences
- form basins via traversal
- preserve ambiguity
- maintain traceable cognition

Manny owns the *geometry*, not the truth.

---

### 3.3 Domain Interpreters (Human)

**Who they are:**
- decision-makers, reviewers, strategists

**Responsibilities:**
- explore the domain
- run Jazz Sessions
- inspect traces and evolution
- make judgments and decisions

Interpreters remain accountable; Manny remains explanatory.

---

## 4. Domain Training & Preparation

Domain training is a staged, auditable process.

### Stage 1 — Canonical Sources

Examples:
- statutes, contracts, filings
- primary data feeds
- foundational research

Goal: establish baseline basins.

---

### Stage 2 — Interpretive Layers

Examples:
- commentary
- analysis
- expert opinions
- research notes

Goal: introduce interference and alternative framings.

---

### Stage 3 — Temporal Evolution

Examples:
- new cases
- new data
- breaking events

Goal: track how understanding shifts over time.

---

### Stage 4 — Challenge & Counterfactuals

Examples:
- minority positions
- dissenting views
- hypothetical stress tests

Goal: prevent premature collapse of meaning.

---

## 5. Cross-Industry Applicability

The same domain strategy applies across sectors:

### Law & Compliance
- evolving interpretations
- provenance of conclusions
- audit-ready reasoning

### Finance & Macro Research
- narrative shifts
- uncertainty tracking
- assumption inspection

### Geopolitics & Policy
- competing narratives
- long time horizons
- explainable disagreement

### Research & Intelligence
- sensemaking
- hypothesis evolution
- traceable inference

---

## 6. Manny’s Product Surfaces

### 6.1 Domain Workspace
- isolated domain manifold
- ingestion & curation controls
- trace exploration UI

### 6.2 Jazz Sessions
- exploratory conversation mode
- observe stream of thought
- replay and comparison

### 6.3 Trace & Evolution Inspector
- what changed
- why it changed
- which inputs mattered

---

## 7. Ownership & IP Model

Principle:
> Clients own their domains. Manny owns the engine.

Implications:
- full domain export available
- no cross-client training
- no silent data reuse
- clean separation of concerns

This model is especially attractive to regulated and high-trust industries.

---

## 8. Monetization Strategy (Aligned)

Manny is monetized as **infrastructure**, not intelligence.

Possible models:
- per-domain licensing
- tiered governance & audit features
- managed hosting for sensitive domains
- enterprise support & tooling

Not sold:
- answers
- predictions
- persuasion

---

## 9. Governance Compatibility

This product strategy is explicitly compatible with:
- canon protection
- safety gates
- staged capability expansion
- research-first governance

Commercial incentives are structurally prevented from altering core cognition.

---

## 10. Why This Scales Sustainably

- low hype
- high trust
- high switching cost (domain history)
- minimal safety risk
- strong alignment with Manny’s philosophy

---

## 11. Summary

Manny’s domain strategy positions it as a **thinking ledger** rather than a thinking agent.

By allowing organizations to *own and inspect their understanding*, Manny delivers immediate value today while preserving the option to explore deeper cognitive capabilities tomorrow — responsibly.
