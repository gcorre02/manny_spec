# Future Research Map (Non-canonical)

Purpose: track post-MVP research directions that are explicitly out of scope for Canonical v1.1. Nothing here is binding; items must not leak into foundations/design/architecture unless explicitly promoted.

Quick links:
- AI movement psychology threads: `future/reference/ai_movement_psychology/`
- Deferred register: `future/deferred_future_work_register.md`
- Human behavior + AGI positioning: `future/human_behavior_and_agi.md`

Governing principle:
> Core cognition remains geometric and invariant. All items below are interpretive, expressive, or derivative layers that may be mapped onto the manifold once the MVP proof is complete.

## 1. AI Movement Psychology & Effort‑Based Expression

**Status:** Deferred (Interpretive / Expressive Layer)

**Source material:**
- Cognitive‑Effort Cube Model
- Laban / Effort theory
- Early Manny movement psychology explorations

**Core idea:**
Investigate whether stable curvature patterns and long‑range manifold dynamics can be *projected* into expressive movement, gesture, or action styles ("working actions"). These models do **not** participate in reasoning or learning; they are readouts.

**How it connects to Manny (later):**
- Map semantic mass + trajectory curvature → effort vectors
- Use executive parameter traces (τ, η, ζ over time) as expressive signals
- Treat movement styles as *projections*, not internal state

**Explicit constraints:**
- Must never influence traversal or curvature updates
- Must never introduce planners or goal stacks
- Must operate as a one‑way read from the manifold

**Promotion trigger:**
Only after free‑fall cognition and semantic mass metrics are empirically validated.

## 2. Cognitive Spectrums (Attending / Deciding / Intending / Adapting)

**Status:** Deferred (Interpretive Axis Mapping)

**Core idea:**
These spectrums describe *human‑interpretable interpretations* of long‑running manifold behavior and executive modulation. They are **labels**, not primitives.

**Refined framing (v1.1):**
These spectrums are best understood as *children of the Experiencer*, not the Executive. They describe transient **states of mind** that influence how threads traverse the manifold (e.g. exploration breadth, stickiness, valence propagation), rather than control parameters that the Executive sets. The Executive may observe aggregate statistics over these dynamics, but must not directly impose them.

**Potential future role:**
- Interpretive overlays for explanation and analysis
- Human‑readable summaries of executive dynamics
- Debugging / visualization lenses

**Explicit constraints:**
- Not encoded as modes
- Not encoded as switches
- Not encoded as cognitive states

- Must be expressible as emergent motion characteristics of threads, not as externally set control knobs

**Promotion trigger:**
Only if they can be derived *purely* from existing manifold observables.

## 3. Narrative, Drama, and Long‑Range Coherence

**Status:** Deferred (Emergent Narrative Research)

**Core idea:**
Explore whether narrative arcs (conflict, tension, resolution) emerge naturally from long‑range curvature evolution and episodic density — without planners or drama managers.

**Acceptable framing:**
- Narrative = interpretation of curvature over time
- Characters = persistent attractor regions
- Conflict = competing basins

**Rejected approaches:**
- Explicit story planners
- HTNs / plot managers
- Goal stacks controlling cognition

**Promotion trigger:**
Requires stable episodic memory and longitudinal mass tracking.

## 4. Embodiment & Sensorimotor Projection

**Status:** Deferred (Post‑MVP Experimental Layer)

**Core idea:**
Investigate whether manifold dynamics can be projected into embodied behavior (robotic or simulated) *without* introducing new cognitive engines.

**Constraints:**
- Embodiment consumes manifold output only
- Sensorimotor loops must not feed back into cognition except via standard percept‑to‑manifold ingestion

**Notes:**
This includes neuromorphic or analog hardware *only* as sensory preprocessors, never as decision logic.

---

## 5. Personality, Style, and Long‑Horizon Identity

**Status:** Deferred (Descriptive Layer)

**Core idea:**
Personality is treated as a statistical description of:
- curvature distribution
- lens usage frequency
- executive modulation trends

**Important:**
Personality is *measured*, not chosen.

**Constraints:**
- No personality parameters injected into cognition
- No behavior shaping outside manifold physics

---

## 6. AGI Positioning & Comparative Research

**Status:** Reference / Analysis Track

**Purpose:**
Track how Manny differs from:
- Symbolic planners
- LLM‑centric agents
- Hybrid cognitive architectures

**Focus:**
- Explainability
- Continuous learning
- Structural emergence

This section informs papers and positioning, not implementation.

## 7. Deferred Items Register (Summary)

See:
- `future/deferred_future_work_register.md`

Items listed there must remain out of scope unless explicitly promoted via a canonical change.

---

## 8. Promotion Rules (Meta)

Any item in this document may only be promoted into canon if:
1. Manny v1.x proof metrics are met
2. The addition does not introduce new reasoning engines
3. The addition can be expressed as a projection or interpretation of existing manifold dynamics
4. Foundations, design, and architecture are updated together

---

## 9. Explicit Non‑Goals

- Re‑introducing planners, solvers, or symbolic controllers
- Encoding psychology as core mechanics
- Hard‑coding behavior styles or narrative arcs
- Diluting the one‑substrate, one‑physics invariant

---

**Status:** Living research map. Non‑canonical. Read‑only during MVP implementation.
