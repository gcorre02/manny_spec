# manny_design — documentation-only repo

This repository is the documentation source of truth for Manny Manifolds. There is no runtime code here.

Canonical documents:
- `foundations.md` — irreducible principles, metrics, and non-negotiables.
- `design_document.md` — contract, requirements, architecture, validation gates.
- `architecture.md` — high-level system shape and tooling choices.
- `archive/` — prior drafts kept for reference only.

Use this repo to read, review, and evolve the design; code lives elsewhere.
