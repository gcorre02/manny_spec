# manny_design — documentation-only repo

This repository is the documentation source of truth for Manny Manifolds. There is no runtime code here.

## Structure
- `canonical/` — canonical documents (source of truth)
  - `foundations.md` — irreducible principles, metrics, and non-negotiables.
  - `design_document.md` — contract, requirements, architecture, validation gates.
  - `architecture.md` — high-level system shape and tooling choices.
  - `validation/validation_framework.md` — hypothesis-driven validation process and report requirements.
- `governance/` — canonical freeze and change rules
  - `canonical_freeze_v1.0.md`
- `future/` — non-canonical ideas compatible with v1.0
  - `deferred_future_work_register.md`
  - `human_behavior_and_agi.md`
- `archive/` — empty placeholder for retired drafts (kept out of canon).

Use this repo to read, review, and evolve the design; code lives elsewhere.
