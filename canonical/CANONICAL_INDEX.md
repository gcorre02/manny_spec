# Canonical Index (v1.1)

Precedence: Foundations → Design → Architecture → Validation. High-level references are advisory; archive is historical.

- `foundations_v1.1.md` — irreducible principles + provisional primitives addendum.
- `design_document_v1.1.md` — normative contract: definitions, gates, Primitive/Compression/Perception contracts, RunModes, semantic mass, lenses, motifs.
- `architecture_v1.1.md` — module/flow spec: motion law, run-modes, ingest contract, semantic mass, executive, Virtual Stage.
- `validation/validation_framework.md` — hypothesis-driven validation process, packs, report schema.
- `validation/observation_emergence_phase_v0.md` — CLEARED phase definition for observational emergence period (OBSERVE-only, no learning/gravity).
  - Clearance record: `validation/observational_emergence_clearance_record_v0.md`
- High-level references: `high_level/` (north-star PDFs, gap analysis, runtime protocol, training track); `background_refs/` (reference-only).
- Archive: `archive/` (v1.0 snapshots, candidate_v1.1 originals) — historical only.
