# Observational Emergence Phase — Clearance Record (v0)

**Status:** ☑ **CLEARED**  
**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Reviewer(s):** Guilherme Ribeiro (initial reviewer)

⸻

## Clearance Decision

**☑ Cleared**

The Observational Emergence Phase has been executed per specification. Baseline, perturbation, and negative-control runs have been archived. Diagnostics are conservative under frozen physics and responsive only in bounded calibration. No learning or gravity has been authorized.

⸻

## Evidence Summary

- Baseline observations captured and replayed
- Perturbation responses documented (lens variations, anchoring strategies)
- Negative controls validated (randomized traversal, flattened curvature, lens-disabled)
- Reproducibility demonstrated (identical runs produce stable diagnostics)
- Diagnostic review conducted without thresholds, pass/fail labels, or rankings
- Documentation summary of observed diagnostic behaviors and open questions recorded

⸻

## Clearance Rationale

Observational Emergence Phase executed per spec. Baseline, perturbation, and negative-control runs archived. Diagnostics conservative under frozen physics and responsive only in bounded calibration. No learning or gravity authorized.

The phase has established a validated observational baseline that distinguishes:
- Intrinsic structural signals
- Lens-induced artifacts
- Random or spurious effects

Observations are sufficiently characterized to inform future learning experiments without redefining diagnostics.

## What This Clearance Authorizes

This clearance authorizes:
- **Consideration** of the Learning Trial Phase (governance decision required)
- Reference to validated baseline diagnostics in future experiments
- Use of established diagnostic vocabulary for future observations

This clearance does **not** authorize:
- Learning mechanisms or LEARN-mode execution
- Intrinsic gravity mechanisms
- Motif promotion beyond staging
- Claims of emergence, meaning, or gravity

⸻

## Next Steps

Transition to a Learning Trial Phase requires:
1. Explicit governance approval via `governance/opening_learning_trial_phase_note.md`
2. Evidence dossier meeting all preconditions
3. Recorded governance decision and rationale

The Learning Trial Phase remains **closed** until explicitly opened by governance.

> **Principle:** Phase clearance establishes evidence and eligibility, not authorization. Learning requires separate governance approval.
