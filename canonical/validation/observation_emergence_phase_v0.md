# Observational Emergence Phase (v0)

## Status
**FROZEN** — Observational Emergence Phase (v0)

This phase is frozen as canonical. Manny operates in OBSERVE-only mode with isolated state. No autonomous learning, intrinsic gravity, or promotion actions are permitted.

## Purpose
This phase defines the period during which Manny’s manifold is *observed* for signs of emergent structure prior to any autonomous learning or intrinsic gravity.

The goal is to establish empirical baselines, perturbation responses, and falsification controls so that any future emergence can be identified as a consequence of the system’s physics rather than engineering artifacts.

This phase prioritizes **truthful observation over capability expansion**.

## Scope

### This phase permits:
- Jazz-based exploration (OBSERVE-only, isolated)
- Systematic collection of emergence diagnostics
- Observational dashboards derived from artifacts
- Controlled perturbations via lenses and anchoring strategies
- Repeated runs under identical seeds for reproducibility

### This phase forbids:
- Autonomous learning or κ modification
- Intrinsic gravity mechanisms or parameters
- Motif promotion beyond staging
- Parameter tuning to influence outcomes
- Semantic interpretation, naming, or claims of meaning
- Canonical promotion of gravity or emergence

Any violation invalidates the phase results.

## Authoritative References
This phase depends normatively on the following specifications:

- `emergence_diagnostics_v0.md` — authoritative vocabulary for observing emergent structure
- `diagnostic_dashboard_spec_v0.md` — constraints on visualization and aggregation
- `jazz_protocol.md` — observational interaction protocol
- `gravity_emergence_spec.md` — constraints on discussing gravity prior to promotion

No other documents may redefine emergence signals during this phase.

## Phase Activities

The following activities are explicitly allowed and encouraged during this phase.

### 1. Baseline Capture (No Learning)
- Run Jazz exploration on:
  - symmetric graphs
  - asymmetric graphs
  - graphs with hidden cross-links
- Capture diagnostics defined in `emergence_diagnostics_v0.md`
- Record multiple seeds under identical conditions

Purpose: establish what structure exists *without learning*.

---

### 2. Controlled Perturbation
- Re-run identical experiments with:
  - novelty lens enabled
  - directional field lens enabled
  - anchoring strategy variations
- Compare diagnostics against baseline runs

Purpose: distinguish intrinsic structure from lens-induced artifacts.

---

### 3. Negative Controls
- Run diagnostics under:
  - randomized traversal order
  - flattened κ or disabled curvature influence
  - lens-disabled configurations

Purpose: ensure diagnostics do not fire spuriously.

---

### 4. Diagnostic Review (Non-Promotional)
- Review diagnostic outputs without thresholds or pass/fail judgments
- Look for:
  - consistency across runs
  - persistence under perturbation
  - lens independence

No promotion or implementation decisions may be made at this stage.


## Phase Readiness and Clearance

This section records the concrete conditions under which the Observational Emergence Phase is considered **well-posed**, **validly executed**, and **eligible for closure**. It is intended to prevent ambiguity about what constitutes completion.

### What Is Already in Place (Entry Conditions)

The following prerequisites are satisfied at the time of freezing this phase:

- Canonical physics definitions (routing, traversal, lenses, plasticity, motifs) are frozen at v1.1
- OBSERVE-only execution mode with write barriers is implemented and enforced
- Jazz protocol is implemented as an observational instrument
- Emergence diagnostics vocabulary is defined (`emergence_diagnostics_v0.md`)
- Diagnostic dashboard constraints are defined (`diagnostic_dashboard_spec_v0.md`)
- Gravity discussion constraints are defined (`gravity_emergence_spec.md`)
- No learning, intrinsic gravity, or promotion mechanisms are active

These conditions ensure that all observations made during this phase are attributable solely to existing physics.

### What Must Be Demonstrated During the Phase

To validly execute this phase, the following must be produced and recorded:

1. **Baseline Observations**
   - At least one complete set of Jazz runs with learning disabled
   - Multiple seeds under identical configurations
   - Diagnostics computed and recorded for each run

2. **Perturbation Responses**
   - Re-runs under novelty and directional field lenses
   - Re-runs under anchoring strategy variations
   - Diagnostics compared against baseline without thresholding

3. **Negative Control Validations**
   - Diagnostics under randomized traversal order
   - Diagnostics with curvature influence flattened or disabled
   - Confirmation that emergence signals do not appear spuriously

4. **Reproducibility Evidence**
   - Successful replay of selected runs
   - Stable diagnostics under identical conditions

No interpretation, naming, or promotion may occur during this step.

---

### What Clears the Phase (Eligibility for Transition)

The Observational Emergence Phase may be declared **complete** when all of the following are true:

- Baseline, perturbation, and negative control runs have been executed and archived
- Diagnostic behavior is understood well enough to distinguish:
  - intrinsic structural signals
  - lens-induced artifacts
  - random or spurious effects
- Observations are sufficiently characterized to design a learning experiment without redefining diagnostics
- A governance review confirms that:
  - OBSERVE-only discipline was maintained
  - No forbidden mechanisms were exercised
  - Results are internally consistent and replayable

Completion requires at least one documented summary of observed diagnostic behaviors and open questions, recorded without interpretation.

Completion authorizes **consideration** of the Learning Trial Phase but does not mandate it.

---

### Explicit Non-Criteria

The following do **not** clear this phase:

- Visual intuition that the manifold "looks structured"
- Single-run or single-seed observations
- Apparent clustering without negative controls
- Diagnostic values exceeding informal or intuitive thresholds
- Any claim of meaning, intelligence, or gravity

---

## Next Phase

Opening of a **Learning Trial Phase** is governed by:

- `experiential_learning_curriculum_v0.md`
- `gravity_promotion_checklist_v0.md`

Transition to the next phase requires an explicit governance decision and recorded rationale.
