# High-level references (supporting, non-foundational)

- `unified_manifold/` — unified manifold PDFs + gap analysis (north-star framing).
- `runtime_protocols/` — runtime protocol and training track references.
- `background_refs/` — surveys, frictions, positioning, exports (reference only).

Promoted to canon: see `foundations_v1.1.md`, `design_document_v1.1.md`, and `architecture_v1.1.md` for the spine operationalized.
