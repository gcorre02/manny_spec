# High-level references (supporting, non-foundational)

Precedence: `canonical/foundations_v1.1.md` → `canonical/design_document_v1.1.md` → `canonical/architecture_v1.1.md` → `canonical/validation/validation_framework.md`. Nothing in `canonical/high_level/` overrides canon.

- `unified_manifold/` — unified manifold PDFs + gap analysis (north-star framing).
- `runtime_protocols/` — runtime protocol and training track references.
- `background_refs/` — surveys, frictions, positioning, exports (reference only).

Promoted to canon: see `foundations_v1.1.md`, `design_document_v1.1.md`, and `architecture_v1.1.md` for the spine operationalized.
