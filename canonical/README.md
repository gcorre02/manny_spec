# Canonical docs (current and history)

## Current canon (v1.1)
- `foundations_v1.1.md` — irreducible principles and addendum on provisional primitives/compression.
- `design_document_v1.1.md` — normative contract: definitions, gates, Primitive/Compression/Perception contracts, RunModes, semantic mass, lenses, motifs.
- `architecture_v1.1.md` — module/flow spec: Primitive Registry, Thread Runner (motion law), Lens/Executive/Virtual Stage, run-modes, ingest contract, semantic mass, advisory indices.
- `validation/` — validation framework/process.
- `governance/` — canonical governance gates (e.g., `gravity_promotion_checklist_v0.md`).
- `high_level/` — north-star references (Unified Manifold PDFs and gap analysis used for v1.1).
  - `background_refs/` — supporting surveys, frictions, positioning, and exports (reference only).
- `CANONICAL_INDEX.md` — authoritative list of canonical docs and precedence.

## Archive
- `archive/` — prior versions and candidate materials.
  - v1.0 snapshots: `foundations_v1.0.md`, `design_document_v1.0.md`, `architecture_v1.0.md`.
  - `candidate_v1.1/` — references used to move from 1.0 → 1.1 (Unified Manifold PDFs, gap analysis).

## Usage
- Treat v1.1 files as the authoritative canon.
- Use archive materials for reference only; they are non-binding unless promoted in a new version.
