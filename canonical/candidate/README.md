# Candidate Specifications

**Status:** Non-canonical / Hypothesis

## What Candidate Specs Are

Candidate specs define:
- **Hypotheses** — proposed behaviors or mechanisms
- **Constraints** — boundaries and forbidden patterns
- **Diagnostics** — how to observe and measure
- **Future permissions** — what may be allowed if evidence supports it

## What Candidate Specs Are NOT

Candidate specs **do not authorize implementation**.

They are exploration documents that help us:
- Think through physics boundaries
- Design experiments
- Clarify what we're testing
- Document constraints before building

## Promotion to Canon

Promotion from candidate to canonical requires:
- **Falsification evidence** — empirical proof that the hypothesis holds
- **Explicit review** — against all suite invariants
- **Versioned process** — new canonical version (e.g., v1.2)
- **Cross-spec validation** — ensuring no conflicts with existing canon

## Important

**Candidate specs do not become canonical by inertia.**

They remain candidate until explicitly promoted through the governance process. This prevents accidental "candidate → canon by inertia" and ensures all canonical changes are intentional and validated.
