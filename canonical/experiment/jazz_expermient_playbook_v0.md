# Jazz Experiment Playbook v0

**Status:** Experimental playbook (non‑canonical)  
**Purpose:** Define repeatable, falsifiable Jazz exploration patterns that treat Jazz as a scientific instrument for observing manifold structure, pre‑emergent behavior, and readiness for learning.

⸻

## 0. Scope

This is:
	•	A guide for running Jazz as controlled experiments
	•	A way to extract diagnostic signal
	•	A complement to Emergence Diagnostics and Gravity v0 experiments

This is not:
	•	A change to Jazz protocol
	•	A new interaction mode
	•	A learning mechanism
	•	A product feature

Jazz remains the same.
This document tells you how to play it seriously.

⸻

## 1. Core Principle

Jazz is an observational instrument, not a conversational interface.

Every Jazz session must be:
	•	replayable
	•	parameterized
	•	logged
	•	interpretable through traces

If a Jazz session can’t be replayed and compared, it’s not an experiment.

⸻

## 2. Experimental Axes

Every Jazz experiment should vary one axis at a time.

Each experiment must vary exactly one axis while holding all others constant.

### 2.1 Anchoring Axis
	•	hub anchors
	•	peripheral anchors
	•	mixed anchors
	•	deliberately “wrong” anchors

Purpose:
	•	detect anchor bias
	•	surface gap sensitivity
	•	test anchor independence

⸻

### 2.2 Lens Axis
	•	no lenses (baseline)
	•	novelty only
	•	directional field only
	•	combined lenses (bounded)

Purpose:
	•	probe latent topology
	•	detect fragile vs robust structure
	•	identify pre-gravitational regions

⸻

### 2.3 Stochasticity Axis
	•	fixed seed (determinism)
	•	low τ
	•	medium τ
	•	high τ (still bounded)

Purpose:
	•	test stability
	•	distinguish structure from noise
	•	find escape thresholds

⸻

### 2.4 Budget Axis (optional, later)
	•	shallow step cap
	•	medium cap
	•	long wandering

Purpose:
	•	observe convergence vs diffusion
	•	detect dead zones
	•	measure escape energy indirectly

⸻

## 3. Canonical Jazz Experiment Types

Each experiment type defines a repeatable observational pattern. These are not scripts, prompts, or UX flows; they are controlled probes of manifold behavior.

⸻

### Experiment Type A — Free Wander (Baseline)

Setup
	•	OBSERVE
	•	no lenses
	•	fixed k, τ
	•	diverse anchors

What you look for
	•	path dispersion
	•	spontaneous convergence
	•	dead regions
	•	accidental corridors

Why it matters
This establishes the unbiased geometry of the manifold.

⸻

### Experiment Type B — Novelty-Guided Wander

Setup
	•	novelty lens enabled
	•	everything else identical to baseline

What you look for
	•	escape from shallow basins
	•	discovery of underused regions
	•	whether novelty collapses or diffuses structure

Interpretation
	•	If novelty destroys coherence → structure is fragile
	•	If novelty reveals corridors → structure is latent

⸻

### Experiment Type C — Directional Field Probe

Setup
	•	directional field toward a region (not a goal)
	•	OBSERVE
	•	bounded lens weight

What you look for
	•	bending of trajectories
	•	resistance vs attraction
	•	path curvature rather than jumps

Interpretation
	•	Smooth bending = healthy topology
	•	Teleportation = bug or cheating

⸻

### Experiment Type D — Symmetry Breaking

Setup
	•	symmetric graph
	•	identical anchors
	•	identical parameters

What you look for
	•	whether symmetry breaks spontaneously
	•	whether bias correlates with lens, seed, or topology

Interpretation
	•	persistent asymmetry → real structure
	•	random asymmetry → noise

⸻

### Experiment Type E — Gap Surfacing

Setup
	•	anchors near suspected missing structure
	•	no learning
	•	OBSERVE only

What you look for
	•	repeated detours
	•	cost spikes
	•	oscillation without convergence

Interpretation
	•	strain = missing abstraction
	•	smooth bypass = structure exists

⸻

## 4. What You Measure (Always)

Every Jazz experiment must emit the following observable artifacts or metrics:
	•	trace distributions
	•	node/edge visit heatmaps
	•	convergence metrics
	•	escape energy proxies
	•	reuse statistics
	•	termination reasons

This feeds directly into Emergence Diagnostics v0.

⸻

## 5. What You Do Not Measure

Jazz experiments must not evaluate:
	•	correctness
	•	relevance
	•	fluency
	•	human-likeness
	•	usefulness of responses

Any evaluation based on subjective usefulness or conversational quality invalidates the experiment.

⸻

## 6. Comparison & Replay

Jazz experiments only become meaningful when you can:
	•	replay with same snapshot + seed
	•	replay with one parameter changed
	•	compare distributions, not anecdotes

Insight comes from difference, not narrative.

⸻

## 7. When Jazz Tells You It’s Time to Learn

Jazz alone should indicate readiness for learning when you see:
	•	consistent path reuse
	•	early basin formation
	•	stable corridors across seeds
	•	repeatable gap strain

Only then does experiential learning with commit gates make sense.

⸻

## 8. Failure Modes (Red Flags)

Terminate the experiment and investigate if any of the following are observed:
	•	convergence driven only by lenses
	•	anchor-specific “stickiness”
	•	unexplained jumps
	•	behavior changes without trace differences
	•	irreproducible sessions

These indicate physics violations, not discovery.

⸻

## 9. Relationship to Other Specs

This playbook uses the Routing & Anchoring Spec unchanged.  
It uses the Traversal Physics Spec unchanged.  
It observes Emergence Diagnostics v0.  
It precedes the Gravity v0 Experiment Plan.

Jazz is the instrument.  
Gravity experiments are the hypothesis test.

⸻

## 10. Summary

Jazz is how Manny observes its own motion under controlled conditions.

This playbook ensures that Jazz sessions produce empirical evidence rather than narrative interpretations.
