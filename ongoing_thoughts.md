- **Locality via activation fronts:** threads operate on an *active k-hop frontier* seeded by an initial activation; no global scans. Neighbor expansion is driven by local edge strength (κ) + lens weights + novelty/valence bias.
- **Emergent cascades:** occasional spontaneous activations (“background noise” / temperature τ) can seed micro-threads; most die out quickly, but high-mass basins amplify them (informational gravity). This yields rare but useful lateral jumps without exhaustive search.
- **“Neurons fire by weights” analogue:** treat node activation as a stochastic event with probability ∝ local potential (edge κ, recent activation, valence). A thread is a *path of successive activations* selected from the active frontier.
- **Primitives:** do **not** need to be encoded as spike patterns for MVP; primitives are currently symbolic units (e.g., words/patches) whose *activation dynamics* approximate firing. If later desired, “firing patterns” can be added as a low-level percept manifold, but must remain advisory (propose activations) and never bypass traversal/κ updates.



could emotion be large gravity wells of meaning? 
could could excitement be massive gravity well formed as expectation (virtual projected field) in connection and balance with the internal gravity well ? anxiety the same

 
how about using llms for manny to engage in a 'conversation' , and just jazz from there? something that can be observable to see where the stream of consciousness goes?
