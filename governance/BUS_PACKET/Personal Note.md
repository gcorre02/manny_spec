**Personal Note**

Manny is my most recent iteration of a lifelong curiosity: understanding myself, other people, and the world. One question has always driven me — *what makes people tick*, and how that expresses itself across every level of experience, from art and psychology to behavior and biology.

Manny is one way I try to stay connected to that question. It is a door I use to engage with the world, and it has expressed itself in many forms over time. This project is simply the current one.

At the very least, I hope Manny inspires curiosity. In the process of ideating and building it, I have already learned a great deal, and taken real pleasure in imagining something elegant, careful, and well-engineered — something with even the smallest chance of offering insight into what makes us human. That experience alone has been valuable to me.

My hope for Manny’s future is that its growth continues to reflect the values that brought it into being: intellectual humility, curiosity, care, and good faith. These matter more to me than outcomes.

I won’t pretend otherwise: I do hope Manny could one day serve as a foundation for further exploration into AGI. At the same time, I’m realistic about both the difficulty of that goal and my own limitations. If Manny contributes meaningfully to the field, that would be wonderful. If it remains a thoughtful curiosity, that is also enough.

I haven’t yet proven that Manny works. But building it has already been worthwhile.

If Manny continues beyond me, I ask that any future evolution be guided by the highest standards of ethics and respect — for human life, biological life, and, perhaps one day, synthetic life as well.
