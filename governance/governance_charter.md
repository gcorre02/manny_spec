# Manny Governance Charter

## Purpose

To ensure Manny's development remains aligned with principles of intellectual humility, safety, explainability, and respect for life, while allowing responsible research and sustainable growth.

## Core Governance Principle

**No capability may be pursued unless its behavior can be observed, replayed, bounded, and reversed.**

⸻

## Canon Protection

The following documents are canonical and immutable except via explicit versioned process:
- Foundations
- Design Contract
- Architecture
- Gap Closure Log

Any change to canon must:
- be justified in writing
- preserve existing invariants
- include a rollback plan

⸻

## Capability Gating

Any proposal involving:
- agency
- self-directed goals
- world modeling
- recursive self-modification

must include:
1. Capability description
2. Risk assessment
3. Observability plan
4. Rollback mechanism
5. Explicit RunMode boundaries

No silent capability expansion is permitted.

⸻

## Separation of Concerns
- Research entity controls canon and direction
- Commercial entity builds products on top of Manny
- Commercial priorities may not dictate core cognition changes
- Research may veto integrations that violate invariants

⸻

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

Manny will not:
- pursue autonomy without governance
- optimize for engagement or persuasion
- claim intelligence it cannot explain
- trade safety for speed or hype

⸻

## Authority

Final authority over Manny's core development resides with the steward(s) of the research entity.

> **This charter is intentionally short.**  
> **Its power comes from structural separation, not enforcement language.**
